Lightweight ubuntu-based OS with KDE and macOS style. # 🍍 PwnappleOS

**PwnappleOS** is a custom Linux distribution based on **Ubuntu** and using the **KDE Plasma** desktop environment, customized to achieve a **macOS-like** aesthetic.



## 🎯 Project Goal

To create a simple script that, when run on a fresh Kubuntu installation, automatically installs key packages and applies customization files to mimic the look and feel of macOS (e.g., using a dock and a global menu).

## 🛠️ How to Achieve the Look

We will use the following tools and settings:

* **Desktop Environment:** KDE Plasma
* **Dock:** **Latte Dock** (or heavily configured Plasma panel)
* **Theme:** A macOS-like global theme (e.g., "Breeze" modified or a custom theme like "Monterey" or "WhiteSur").

## 📄 License

This project will use the **MIT License**.
